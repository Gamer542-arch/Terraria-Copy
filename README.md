What you need:
Python (Latest Version, Python.org)
The pyautogui library, the command is pip install pyautogui
and the Keyboard Library, the command is pip install keyboard
You need to do all this in a new terminal window
because it won't recognize that it's Python.

To run it, I think you need py scripy.py
If it doesn't work, reopen the cmd window (Right-click and select Open in Terminal) in the folder where the script is located.

The script stops when you press ctrl + shift + tab, and after waiting 3 seconds, the script stops running. You can also close the script window.

Enjoy using it.
